      <li>1/4 cup shortening, plus more for greasing</li>
      <li>3 cups flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cold butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups whole buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon bacon grease or shortening</li>
      <li>3 slices country ham</li>
      <li>softened butter, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch
        cast-iron skillet with shortening.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a food processor, sift together
        flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cream of tartar. Mix or pulse a
        few times to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut butter and 1/4 cup shortening into flour mixture just until you get
        a crumbly consistency. Add buttermilk to flour mixture. Gently stir
        until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn out dough onto a floured surface. With floured hands, pat dough to
        approximately 2-inch thickness. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut
        out 6 to 8 biscuits. Transfer to greased skillet. Bake until golden
        brown, about 30 minutes. Remove biscuits from oven and let cool 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While biscuits are baking, cook ham: Add bacon grease to a cast-iron
        skillet over medium heat. Add ham slices and fry until edges are brown,
        a few minutes per side. Remove ham from skillet and place on a paper
        towelâ€“lined plate to drain. Cut each slice in half.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve, split each biscuit in half, spread with softened butter, and
        sandwich with a piece of ham.
      </li>
